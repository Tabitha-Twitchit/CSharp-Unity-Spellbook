        /*WHAT IF instead of DESTROYING an animal after it eats, it turns around to go somewhere else? This ALSO makes the game more fun
       because if the critter turns around and bonks another critter before it gets away it will get spooked and turn back so ya gotta 
       feed it again. This creates a wild ass cloud of bonkin critters you gotta triage and count how many bonks or food they need.
