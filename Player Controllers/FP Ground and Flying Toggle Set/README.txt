A series of controllers and a script that toggles among them allowing both FP ground based movement and flying "noclip"
style movement along with an optional flying mode that locks out mouse movement which was used for line drawing on flat
 planes using the Line Draw C script. Locking to that camera is controlled via a keypress on the midivisual controller 
iirc but could be placed wherever. See screenshot for relevant script placement and hierarchy.
